    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This document is an introduction to **Graph-Rewriting Automata** (GRA).\n",
    "\n",
    "GRA are an extension of **Cellular Automata** to a dynamic structure using local graph-rewriting rules. In this framework, initially simple graphs can evolve into complex self-organized structures. GRA display complex behaviors and can thus constitute a useful model of natural phenomena.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Graph-Rewriting Automaton** {cite}`tomita2007self,tomita2007asynchronous,tomita2009graph` consists of:\n",
    "* an **initial graph** $G_0$ defined at time step $t=0$,\n",
    "* a **rule** to iteratively evolve it to any discrete time step $t>0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$G_t$ is the graph obtained at time $t$.\n",
    "\n",
    "![example](images/gra-example.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following, a linear algebra based approach to GRA will be presented along with code examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{seealso}\n",
    "For a wonderful animated implementation, check out **Alexander Mordvintsev**'s [Growing Graphs](https://znah.net/graphs/)!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "````{important}\n",
    "The code examples relie on the [**GRA** python package](https://github.com/paulcousin/gra-python). To install it on your computer, type the following command in your terminal.\n",
    "```{code}\n",
    "pip install gra\n",
    "```\n",
    "````\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "The concepts presented here are in the continuity of a previous work {cite}`cousin2022organic` that was implemented in [Mathematica](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/). This code can be found in a dedicated [GitHub repository](https://github.com/paulcousin/gra-mathematica). The new python implementation leverages [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org) and has more functionality. However, since Mathematica offers more appropriate graph plotting functions, it has been used to generate the plots of the *Gallery* section.\n",
